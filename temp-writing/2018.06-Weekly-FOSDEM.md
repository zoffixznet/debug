# Whatever FOSDEM Squashed

As *lizmat++* is currently enjoying a well-deserved rest in the Caribbean, today's Weekly is guest-written by a Zoffix! Hopefully, it's still good.

It's been a slow week, as many Sixers are attending the *Free and Open Source Software Developers' European Meeting (FOSDEM)*. As was mentioned in [an earlier Weekly](https://p6weekly.wordpress.com/2018/01/08/2018-02-fosdem-nearing/), there will be some Perl 6 talks. The videos for them already started rolling in: [Perl 6 on Jupyter by Brian Duggan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSZV8IXIsM4) ([sides](https://github.com/bduggan/p60j) and [code](https://github.com/bduggan/p60j)).

So far, the event seems to be going well:

> &lt;tyil&gt; the perl stand at fosdem was awesome, much more people that<br>
           showed interest in Perl 6 than I imagined

## SQUASHathon

This weekend saw our 6th [Monthly SQUASHathon](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/Monthly-Bug-Squash-Day) happen. This month's topic was squashing tickets marked with *testneeded* label and the participants [made 47 commits](https://gist.github.com/Whateverable/71523b3eb60371f9426b810ffa9a9300) towards that effort.

## 2018.01 Rakudo Star Binaries, Still Pending

*stmuk++* is still testing the binary Release Candidates for 2018.01 release of Rakudo Star. You can help out by [downloading the RC0 binaries](http://pl6anet.org/drop/) and [reporting](https://github.com/rakudo/star/issues/new) any problems you find.

## Core Developments

This week, [48 tickets were handled](https://gist.github.com/Whateverable/7663508fb63b40bfe9d47957764debc8), with 26 of them resolved.

* *ash++* implemented a [`push-all` optimization](https://perl6.party/post/Perl-6-Seqs-Drugs-and-Rock-n-Roll--Part-2#pushitrealgood...) to [`List.roll`](https://docs.perl6.org/routine/roll)
* *nine++* made several improvements to start up speed, by improving code of `Stash.merge-symbols`, optimizing `CompUnit::PrecompilationUnit::deserialize`, as well as moving setup of certain objects like `$*PERL` and `$*VM` to compile time (this work is still ongoing)
* *MasterDuke++* continued working on implementing JIT templates for various ops, merging 30 more this week.
* *ugexe++* fixed CompUnit::RepositoryRegistry to point to correct location for home repository
* *samcv++* added support for windows-1251 (Cyrillic) encoding on both MoarVM and JVM, and fixed several bugs in windows-1252 encoding with several characters not being correctly encoded
* *pmurias++* continued working on the JS backed, dealing with utf8-c8 encoding
* *Kaiepi++* improved docs and `Configure.pl` option for building MoarVM
* *jstuder-gh++* fixed a bug with `state` variables inside a `do loop`
* *titsuki++* and *jnthn++* de-bittrotted [nqp repository's](https://github.com/perl6/nqp/) files and documentation
* *dogbert17++* fixed segfaults when errors were encountered while opening `MVM_*_LOG` files
* *brrt++* added a NOOP expr JIT operator
* *timotimo++* made sure PHI were not output into expr JIT log as well as [made a proposal for datagram-oriented API for UDP sockets](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/1473)
* *zoffix++* redesigned the [`Whatever`](https://docs.perl6.org/type/Whatever),
[`WhateverCode`](https://docs.perl6.org/type/WhateverCode),
and [`HyperWhatever`](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/760) currier, fixing a number of bugs, as well as making nested `Whatever` closures faster to compile and run (a 5-arg `Whatever` now runs 2.2x faster and compiles 8% faster). Also, made [`.=` method calls](https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#postfix_.=) 39x-64x faster.

Other assorted core work included:

* Fixed a bug in [`sort`](https://docs.perl6.org/routine/sort)ing a 2-element list with arity-2 sorter
* Fixed crashes in compile-time executed `where` thunks
* Changed semantics of [`:b` quoter tweak](https://docs.perl6.org/language/quoting#index-entry-%3Ab_%28quoting_adverb%29), to behave more like `qq` quoter, fixing a bug in `:b:s` quoter combination
* Fix bogus error in REPL when a [`none` `Junction`](https://docs.perl6.org/type/Junction) was a result of the expression
* Fixed crash with `ENTER` [phaser](https://docs.perl6.org/language/phasers#phasers__ENTER) nested inside `LEAVE` phaser
* Fixed crash in [`Proxy.perl`](https://docs.perl6.org/type/Proxy)

## *Learning Perl 6*

The [Learning Perl 6](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1422827986/learning-perl-6) book by *brian d foy* has reached a milestone in its production: all of the research has been completed. All that remains to do is cleaning everything up and doing a bit of rework on some chapters.
